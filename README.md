# Quantum Computing for Materials Design

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a hybrid quantum-classical workflow for simulating the electronic structure of ethylene (C₂H₄) using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). The goal is to compute the ground-state energy and compare results with classical methods like DFT and FCI.

## Key Features
- **Classical Preprocessing**: DFT geometry optimization and Hamiltonian generation using PySCF.
- **Quantum Computation**: VQE with error mitigation on a noisy quantum simulator.
- **Postprocessing**: Benchmarking against DFT and FCI results.
